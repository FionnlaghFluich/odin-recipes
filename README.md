# odin-recipes 
This project will be a very basic recipe website coded in html only.
Skills I will develop will include making images, links, boilerplate, lists and using elements and tags to format the text correctly. I will also learn better how git and github function (which I have struggled with understanding) and becoming better knowledgable of the command line and how to alter files in different ways on it (something I have also struggled with a bit).
REMEMBER TO COMMIT, commiting regularly will be difficult for me since I still do not have a good grasp of it yet.
