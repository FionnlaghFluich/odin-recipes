    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and prehead the oven to 220 degrees C</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over the medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in the chicken broth and milk</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top.</li>
        <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden bronwn and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
